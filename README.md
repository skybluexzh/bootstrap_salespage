# bootstrap_salespage
 Build a simple website for a fictional, mobile application called Gamma which is a photo sharing app.
 
 Basically, we have a landing page here, a bootstrap formatted page. We have the navbar, we have the main showcase area or jumbotron as it’s called in Bootstrap. And then, if you scroll down, we have there three columns here with images, texts and buttons. And then, we have kind of a features section. It has a background color. We have an image, we have some bullet points that are using the icons that Bootstrap offers. It’s responsible, you can see that it changes to fit the screen. You’ll notice, if we go past a certain point, that the large iPhone image disappears just because it’s much too big and cluttered on a smaller screen. You can see as we go down to the mobile size, it looks really good. So everything fits nicely. And then we just have a basic footer at the bottom. It’s the home page. We also have a couple other page, the about page, we have this title heading area, we have some text, we’re using the Accordion module that bootstrap offers. And then, we just have a simple sidebar with an image and some text. And then, the contact page, we just have a bootstrap formatted form and sidebar.
